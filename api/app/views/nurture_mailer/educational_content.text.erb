PRO TIP FOR THIS WEEK
======================
<% case @content_focus %>
<% when 'setup_basics' %>
ðŸ’¡ Perfect Placement Matters: Place temperature sensors away from heat sources (like radiators or direct sunlight) for accurate readings. A difference of just 2Â°C can trigger false alerts!
<% when 'advanced_configuration' %>
ðŸ’¡ Smart Alerts Save Time: Set up cascading alert thresholds. Start with warnings at 80% of your critical level, then alerts at 95%. This gives you time to respond before issues become emergencies.
<% when 'scaling_optimization' %>
ðŸ’¡ Data Patterns Reveal Insights: Look for weekly and monthly patterns in your data. Many users discover energy-saving opportunities or predict maintenance needs by analyzing long-term trends.
